# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Kickstarter funding analysis for future campaign to determine timing, funding goal and donation ask amount
* In examining the results of Theater Kickstarter Campaigns based in the US, four major factors seem to lead to successful results.
* First factor is the total funding goal, which seems to be around $5000. Failed campaigns have of goal of double that amount. 
* The second factor is a donation amount around $90. The unsuccessul campaigns had a $50 donation average. Ask for a reasonable donation amount not too low or high. 
* The third factor is campaign length. The successful campaigns ran for a month or less, while the failed campaigns tended to run longer (average of 34 days). 
* The fourth factor is timing. The successful Kickstarter campaigns start in May. So plan to have your campaign launch in May.
